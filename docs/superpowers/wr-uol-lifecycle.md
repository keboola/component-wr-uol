# keboola.wr-uol — New Component Build Lifecycle

> **For agents (read this first):** This file is the **durable, cross-session source of truth** for
> building this new component. `TodoWrite` resets every session; this file does not. Whenever you
> start work on this component — in any skill, in any session — open this file, find the phase you
> own, and act on it.
>
> **The loop for every phase:**
> 1. Read this file; find your phase and the phase(s) before it. Earlier phases are dependencies —
>    if one isn't ticked, resolve it (or surface the blocker) before starting yours.
> 2. Do the phase's work.
> 3. Dispatch the **phase verifier** (see *Verification contract* below) as a fresh subagent.
> 4. **Only tick `- [x]` when the verifier returns ✅ with real evidence** — never on your own
>    say-so. Paste the evidence line under the phase.
> 5. Commit this file (`git add` + commit) so the next session sees the new state.
>
> Mirror the still-open phases into `TodoWrite` for the live in-session checklist, but treat *this
> file* as authoritative.

## Verification contract

A phase is "done" only when it's confirmed against **real evidence** by a check that is independent of
the work itself.

**Preferred — dispatch a fresh subagent** (the `Task`/`Agent` tool) so the verifier has a clean context
and no implementer bias. **If subagent dispatch isn't available to you**, run the verification yourself
as a *separate, deliberate pass*: re-derive every piece of evidence from scratch (run the commands,
read the actual files, query the platform/portal/git as needed) and do **not** lean on your own earlier
claims about what you did. Either way, give the verifier the phase's **Definition of done** and this
instruction:

> Verify ONLY whether this phase is genuinely complete, by gathering **real evidence** — run the
> commands, read the actual files, query the platform/portal/git as needed. Do **not** fix or change
> anything; you are a checker, not an implementer. Return either:
> - `✅ DONE` followed by the concrete evidence you observed (command output, file paths, job IDs,
>   tag names — the specifics), or
> - `❌ NOT DONE` followed by exactly what is missing or failing.
>
> If you cannot confirm a requirement with evidence, default to `❌ NOT DONE`. "Should be fine" is not
> evidence.

If the verifier returns ❌, the box stays unticked — fix the gap and re-verify. This mirrors the
superpowers principle: *evidence before assertions, always.*

## Phases

Later phases generally depend on earlier ones, so work top-down. Where two adjacent phases are
genuinely independent (Phase 6 portal value-setup and Phase 7 cf-dev smoke-test don't depend on each
other — both only need Phases 1–5), either order is fine.

### Phase 1 — Scaffold + bootstrap release · owner: `component-get-started` (verified here by `component-plan-new`)
- [x] complete

**Definition of done:**
- Repo pushed to `origin` under the correct org; initial commit on `main`.
- Per-repo portal creds set for the **target vendor**: `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME` (variable) +
  `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD` (secret).
- Dev Portal **app created** (via `kbagent dev-portal create`) — the release pipeline needs a target.
- `0.0.1` tag exists and its `push.yml` run **built and pushed the image** (run is green).

> Note: `get-started` runs *before* this tracker exists. `component-plan-new` creates this file and
> runs the Phase 1 verifier retroactively to confirm the scaffold actually landed before planning.

**Evidence:** Verified 2026-06-08. Repo `keboola/component-wr-uol` public, branch `main`. `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_USERNAME`=`keboola+ComponentFactory_CI` (variable) + `KBC_DEVELOPERPORTAL_PASSWORD` (secret) both set. Dev Portal app `keboola.wr-uol` exists under vendor `keboola`. Release `0.0.1` (2026-06-08T08:29:47Z) — workflow run 27125404637 `completed/success` in 2m53s.

### Phase 2 — Research the source/target system · owner: `component-plan-new`
- [x] complete

**Definition of done:** a research summary settles API style(s), auth method(s) and which the vendor
recommends, pagination, rate limits, incremental/cursor support — plus a **feasibility & provisioning
verdict** (sandbox availability, headless-auth vs admin-only setup). Blockers surfaced to the user.

**Evidence:** Verified 2026-06-08 (fresh subagent). Spec §3: REST/JSON, HTTP Basic (only method UOL
offers). §4: offset pagination (`page`/`per_page`, max 250); rate limits 30 req/10s (10 for
receivables), 429 backoff. §2: writer → no `state.json` watermark (incremental is platform input
mapping). §3 provisioning: fully self-service token (Settings ▸ Technical ▸ API tokens), public DEMO
instance available — no blockers. §9: 5 risks documented, upsert resolved by design.

### Phase 3 — Spec + implementation plan · owner: `component-plan-new`
- [x] complete

**Definition of done:** `docs/superpowers/specs/...-design.md` committed (full scope: source system,
Keboola mapping, auth/provisioning, data model, config/schema, code architecture, datadir + VCR
tests, cf-dev deployment, risks) with **no placeholders/TODOs**, AND a superpowers plan committed at
`docs/superpowers/plans/...md`. User approved the spec.

**Evidence:** Verified 2026-06-08 (fresh subagent). Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-wr-uol-design.md`
(283 lines, §§1–9, placeholder grep CLEAN, commits `54e8569`/`a801e1f`/`b713bac`). Plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-wr-uol.md` (commit `865ddb7`): required header + 11 bite-sized TDD
tasks with real code (18 code blocks, 53 checkboxes), covers full spec scope. User approved spec by
invoking `/superpowers:writing-plans`.

### Phase 4 — Implement on `initial-implementation` branch · owner: `component-develop`
- [ ] complete

> **How this gets executed:** the superpowers plan (Phase 3) is worked task-by-task via
> `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, with implementation tasks dispatched to `component-develop`
> (schema/UI → `component-build-ui`). This box gates the *milestone* — tick it on the verifier's ✅,
> not when the plan's last task is checked off.

**Definition of done:** branch `initial-implementation` exists; component logic implemented per the
plan; `run()` is a clean orchestrator with logic in private methods; `ruff check` clean. Fine-grained
step tracking lives in the superpowers plan file — this box tracks the phase as a whole.

**Evidence:** _

### Phase 5 — Local VCR tests + cassettes · owner: `component-test`
- [ ] complete

**Definition of done:** datadir/unit/VCR tests present; the **full `pytest` suite runs green** (paste
the `N passed` line, not "should pass"); cassettes recorded and **verifiably sanitized** — grep every
cassette for secret patterns (the values from `secrets.json`, common keys like `token`/`password`/
`authorization`/`api_key`, and the configured `VCR_SANITIZERS` targets) and paste a clean result.

**Evidence:** _

### Phase 6 — Full Developer Portal value setup · owner: `component-dev-portal`
- [ ] complete

**Definition of done — MUST happen *after* the `0.0.1` release:** configSchema (and row schema if
config rows), sync actions, and the portal-owned properties (descriptions, UI options, etc.) are live
in the portal, confirmed via a fresh `kbagent dev-portal` GET.

> **Ordering, do not get this wrong:** the `0.0.1` release's CI-sync writes portal values from the
> repo. If you set portal values *before* that release, the release **overwrites** them. The bootstrap
> release already happened in Phase 1, so this manual value setup is safe here — but if any further
> release is cut afterwards, re-confirm the synced-vs-portal-owned property boundary.

**Evidence:** _

### Phase 7 — Deploy + smoke-test in cf-dev (image-tag override) · owner: `component-test` (tier 4)
- [ ] complete

**Definition of done:** an image built from the `initial-implementation` branch exists in the
platform; a config created in the **cf-dev** project (via kbagent) with the **image tag overridden**
to that branch build; a real job run **succeeded** end-to-end. Evidence must include the job ID, its
`success` status, **and the resolved image tag the job actually ran** — confirm it matches the
`initial-implementation` build, not a stale stable release (a green job against the wrong image is a
false pass).

**Evidence:** _

### Phase 8 — Final CF-standards review · owner: `component-checklist-review`
- [ ] complete

**Definition of done:** `component-checklist-review` run over the full implementation; no open **blocking**
(critical/important) findings; component aligns with Component Factory standards.

> **If you cut a release after Phase 6** (e.g. promoting the reviewed component to a stable version),
> the CI property-sync runs again and overwrites the `[script]` portal properties from the repo —
> **re-run the Phase 6 verifier afterward** to confirm the portal-owned values survived. Phase 6 is
> only protected from the *bootstrap* `0.0.1` release automatically.

**Evidence:** _
